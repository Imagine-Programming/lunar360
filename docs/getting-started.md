# Getting Started
Using lunar360 can be as easy as double clicking the released binary and using the included default implementation in lunar360.lua. 

1. Connect any XInput controller to your system via Bluetooth, an XBox dongle or USB cable.
2. Start lunar360.exe.
3. Use your controller and control the mouse and keyboard input.
4. Stop lunar360.exe in the system tray by right clicking <img src="icon-noface-512.png" width="16" height="16" alt="lunar360 icon 16x16"> and select Exit.

### Customizing Behavior
If you prefer other behavior than what is made possible by the included version of lunar360.lua, you can modify the implementation and have it do whatever you would like. For this, check out the [API reference](api/overview.md) in the documentation.
